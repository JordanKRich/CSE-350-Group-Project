        <p_jr>I am a BACS student who is
            <span class="sparkles_jr">passionate</span> 
            about all things dogs, and family. I originally started out studying nursing at 
             but after completing most of my degree there I discovered my love for technology and changed my major to 
            <span class="sparkles_jr">Computer Science</span>. I grew up in Hopedale, MA,
            but after marrying a Combat Medic in the Army, we were relocated to Louisville.
            I spend much of my time studying web development, taking care of rescue dogs, and training for 5k's.
            My goal is to become confident in my self and my skills.
